# Python-Minor-Projects-
Hello Everyone, I am Binayak Koirala and these are some basic python minor projects which I have done while I was learning python. 
I have done these projects with the help of my mentor and my friends.
I have used many libraries such as Tkinter, datetime, pywhatkit, speech recognition, pyqrcode etc, in these projects which has helped to make it amazing. 
I hope you like it. 
Have a great day everyone.
